You like watching the sci-fi channel? VWlUSGFjazI Well, I LOVE watching the sci-fi channel.  
In fact, my preferred nickname is the white tail; we0lfd2lsbF because I am a woman who knows 
just how to kill her prey, using the same methods of the white tail spider…you see, 
I’ve already lured you out of your home and by now you have been stung and understand 
you’re in a real messed 9maW5kX3lvd up situation.  We are back inside your house…YOU, completely 
immobile, ME, preparing to devour the rest of you.  This is what I do…

(she puts on rubber gloves)

I will slowly creep under your skin and begin taking it off.  Bit by bit.  Until there 
is no skin left.  Well, there will be skin, V9hdF9VaVRI, but just a pile of it to the side like dirty laundry.  
It’s really gonna freak you out when you see what I’m talking about.  It’s actually 
quite a good analogy.  (beat)  After the skin peeling which should take less than an hour–used to 
take me longer but I’ve had loads of practice.  What was I saying?  Oh YWNrX3hveG9!  Once I have the skin 
laundry phase complete we will…you know what?  I’ll let you be surprised, this way you can enjoy the 
entire experience as this is your first and final rodeo.

Sound good?

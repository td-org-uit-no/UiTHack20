# Snake trap

> Crypto - 200pts

You're walking through a dark corridor with a torch raised high when you suddenly hear a click beneath you. 
The floor collapses and you fall into the darkness below.
In the room you hear faint hisses from all around you. You start swiping your torch to drive away the countless snakes you now see in the surrounding shadows.\
Along one of the walls is a tablet with the following inscription:

``Long may he reign, the master, the dark lord. He who shall not be named.
``

As you walk through the room you see that the snakes get as close to torchlight as possible. The left and right walls are embellished with large murals of terrifying snakes. 
Along the opposite wall you see a series of numbers, as well as a series of inputs. \
Perhaps this is your way out. Luckily you brought your codebook with you.

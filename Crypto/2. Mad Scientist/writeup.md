>While exploring the inner chambers of a dark castle our find yourself in a room filled with various alchemial components and utensils.
>At the center of the room there is a desk with intricate glass vials and tubes.
>On the table you see a paper slip with the following numbers:
>
>``92 53 90 89 19 Ca 55 53 16 1 92 32 49 16 57 23 7 85 92 75``
>

The numbers represent the atomic number of elements in the periodic table. Replacing each number with its corresponding letter and replacing Ca with its atomic number we get: 

``U I TH AC K 20 CS I S H U GE IN S LA V N AT U RE``

Formatting this to the format of the flag we get:

``UiTHack20{cs_is_huge_in_slav_nature}``

While exploring the inner chambers of a dark castle you find yourself in a room filled with various chemial components and utensils.
At the center of the room you see a large desk with intricate glass vials and tubes.
On the desk you see a paper slip with the following numbers:

``92 53 90 89 19 Ca 55 53 16 1 92 32 49 16 57 23 7 85 92 75``

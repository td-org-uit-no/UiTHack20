# Endless spiral
> Crypto - 200pts

In the old, rusty house the basement door opens. With the knowledge that every horrormovie plots start the same way, with the kid going down to the dark basement, you go towards the door. 
Over the door a warning is uttered: *Those who enters, will never come out, without the the guide on the wall, there is no hope. The spiral will continue.*
You start walking down the spiral staircase noticing a repeating pattern along the walls, realizing this is the guide you will need to have in order to exit the staircase.

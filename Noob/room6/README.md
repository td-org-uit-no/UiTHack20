# room6
> Noob - 300pts

I have a gift for you which is wrapped extra super good for you. And a secret is inside. It's not a baseball.  

To enter the rooms you will need to connect through `ssh`.
The username for this first room, is `room6`
The server name is `sparkly-unicorn.td.org.uit.no`.
The password for room6 is the flag from the `room5` challenge.



Tips:
`ssh room6@sparkly-unicorn.td.org.uit.no`

Is something done with this file? How can you undo it?

# room3
> Noob - 150pts

How can you find just one string? This must be a new type of torture. Or perhaps an old one.
either way, I'm glad I know how to read long texts.  

To enter the rooms you will need to connect through `ssh`.
The username for this first room, is `room3`
The server name is `sparkly-unicorn.td.org.uit.no`.
The password for room3 is the flag from the `room2` challenge.



Tips:
`ssh room3@sparkly-unicorn.td.org.uit.no`

Tips:
Can you extract only the string you need from file? What do we know of its standard format?

### Planning:


#### UiTHack 2020 - thoughts and challenges

###### Motivation and vision

Copied from last year:
> We want to create more interest and enthusiasm for security and related problems for students. 
> For this, a noob-friendly Capture-the-flag competition is perfect!
> The idea is to expose people to gradually more challenging tasks, starting with very simple ones and moving to more complex ones. None should be too hard and some help will be given for those in need. 

##### Challenge Categories
We define the following categories of challenges, with a minimum of three(3) in each category and up to six(6). (Ideas are welcome)

###### Noob
Usually file/shell manipulation in Bash
- [] Classics: cat, .filename, using find
- [] Unzipping different formats was fun and challenging last year

###### Pwn
Pwn the system: gain access to some system with a buffer overflow, code injection, password cracking...
- [] Python eval exploitation

###### Reverse Engineering
Pick apart the program to figure out how it works
- [] input with strong constraints

###### Crypto
Classic ciphers and number fun 

###### Web
Fun with websites and web code
- [] Some kind of XSS
- [] network traces?

###### IRL
Challenges on site: lock-picking, treasure hunting or whatever else

###### Misc
Any other challenges we can come up with
- [] Esoteric horrorshow (brainfuck? Piet? Whitespace?)
- [] Whitespace could hide in another language (like C)
- [] GLADoS
- [] "mad scientist" C stuff

# Frankensteins monster

Frankensteins monster is angry with you. 
You can try run. You can try to hide. 
What you can't do, is run forever. 
The monster never tires, never rests and will always outlast you.
Your only choice is to distract the monster. 

Luckily for you, Dr. Frankenstein has [contingencies](http://fire-breathing-unicorn.td.org.uit.no:56733/).

# Haunted house
> Reverse Engineering - TBD pts

You find yourself in an old haunted house. To advance to the next rooms you need to enter a passphrase based on a challenge infront of you. <br>
Except nothing is real and you only have a binary file for the house.
There are 3 steps, each with a unique passphrase.

Good luck.
